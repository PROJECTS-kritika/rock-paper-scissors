# rock-paper-scissors
 developed this project by using python. This is the project of rock-paper-scissors and In this project, I type 0 for rock, 1 for paper, 2 for scissors. The rock is when you place your hand into the form of a simple fist. The paper is when you place your hand in an outstretched position. This is when you hold your fist with your index and middle finger pointing outwards in a V shape. The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules: 1. Rock wins against scissors. 2. Scissors win against the paper. 3. Paper wins against rock.
